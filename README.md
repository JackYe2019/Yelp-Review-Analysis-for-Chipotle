Yelp Review Analysis for Chipotle
Chipotle has been losing customers and isn’t performing well in the competitive fast-casual dining industry these years.
It tried many methods to improve customer experience and regain customers such as establishing new safety protocols and introducing digital ordering channels such as online and mobile app ordering. 
As Chipotle embraces increasingly modern strategies, we recommend a data-driven approach to help it improve business. 
In this project, we use several natural language processing tools to analyze its reviews on Yelp to discover areas of improvement and propose suggestions accordingly.


Main components of the Chipotle project:
1. Apply Textblob to calculate the sentiment polarity of each review.

2. Draw word clouds for positive and negative reviews respectively to see what words appear frequently in positive or negative reviews.

3. Use the LDA Mallet to do topic modeling to extract six topics from all reviews, and calculate the average sentiment scores for each topic. Draw a radar graph to show which topics are Chipotle’s advantages and which are its disadvantages.
Do time series analysis of word sentiment, through which we see the monthly change of occurrence frequency of important words such as “line” and “burrito” in the positive or negative reviews. Based on this, we can detect the pain points of Chipotle’s key business.

4.Based on our analysis, we provide Chipotle with four suggestions in the areas of ingredient quality, wait times and digital ordering. The first one is to improve the freshness and quality of its ingredients to regain its strategic strength. The second one is to investigate the supply chain to see how to improve the quality and taste of its proteins, especially chicken. The third one is to investigate the current quality of its most important product, burrito, which has gone fewer and fewer positive reviews. At last, Chipotle should improve the online ordering system and mobile app, in order to better solve the wait time problem and improve customers’ buying experience.
